My Udacity Front-End Arcade Game Project.

This is a project on the Front-End Udacity Nanodegree course, based on knowledge of Object Oriented Programming.

I used [howlerjs](https://howlerjs.com/) for the sounds.

This is a very simple game, all you have to do is avoid the bugs and get to the to the river safely.

Use your direction buttons for navigation.
