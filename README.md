#  Udacity Front-End Arcade Game Project. #

This is a project on the Front-End Udacity Nanodegree course, testing my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming.

You can download the project [here](https://github.com/abiodunolunu/Arcade-Game/archive/master.zip)

This is a very simple game, all you have to do is avoid the bugs and get to the to the river safely.

Use your direction buttons for navigation.
